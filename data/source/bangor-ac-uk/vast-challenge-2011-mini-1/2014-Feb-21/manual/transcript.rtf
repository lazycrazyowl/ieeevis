== Tracking spread of outbreak ==\
\
In order to find the onset and track the spread of the outbreak,\
we first use the word cloud to find days where feature prominently.\
\
Here we select the date range between the 18th and 21st of May, \
giving us the most common symptoms mentioned over this three day period.\
The word \'93chills\'94 seems to feature most prominently, \
so we can search on this using the $ prefix which will only return tweets that mention the word in a first person context,\
such as \'93I have chills\'94 or \'93these chills\'94.\
We can then search for other prominent symptoms like fever, sweats, coughing, and sickly.\
\
Tracking backwards through time, we find that the onset of these symptoms follow a distinct cone-shaped pattern.\
\
We can also see here that people only start mentioning these symptoms outside the cone after 6pm \'97 outside work hours.\
\
Overlaying weather information, we also see that this cone matches the wind direction on the day.\
\
There is, however, a set of gastrointestinal symptoms that show a different pattern of spread.\
Here, we see that nausea and diarrhea, followed by vomiting, abdominal pain, and coughing of blood appear to follow the southward flowing river.\
\
== Identifying ground zero ==\
\
In order to identify the most likely candidate for Ground Zero, \
we can again use the word cloud to look for events trending on and around the initial onset.\
\
On the 17th of May, we see the word \'93explosions\'94 trending, so if we search for that,\
we find that it doesn\'92t really seem to fit the pattern of spread.\
\
Another incident featured in the word cloud is a truck on fire and spilling cargo onto the 1610 highway bridge.\
Comparing this event to the two airborne and river vectors, we see that it occurs at just the right time and place to be the likely ground zero.\
\
== Is there any person-to-person transmission? ==\
\
In order to investigate the possibility of person-to-person spread, \
we first need to look for a large event taking place during the outbreak.\
\
The word cloud indicates that a technology convention takes place on the 18th of May,\
where we would expect the disease to spread.\
\
At this stage, we also search for terms these particular people would likely say, such as \'91technology\'92 and \'91airport\'92.\
\
If we isolate and select people that mention \'91convention\'92 over this period, we can cross-reference with the other filter terms.\
Here we see that practically no one at the convention later mentions being ill.\
\
Another possibility is that the disease is spread to friends, family, or caregivers of the ill.\
However, if we search for occurrences of chills in the third person context such as \'93John is ill\'94 or \'93Jane is ill\'94, \
and compare the results with occurrences of chills mentioned in the first person,\
we see there is also no evidence for person-to-person spread \'97 there is practically no crossover.\
\
== Was the outbreak contained? ==\
\
Switching to the heat map view, we see that while the airborne symptoms are mostly clustered in the downtown and uptown regions, areas outside the city could potentially still be affected due to the flowing river.\
