"VAST2013","MC1 - Box Office VAST - Predictive Visual Analytics","VAST Challenge 2013 Mini-Challenge 1 concerns predictive visual analytics. It is decidedly different from previous VAST challenges - it will be continuous and iterative, it will have reviewing and recognition presented from now until the final judging session, contestants will be required to register to participate and login to this site to get data and make submissions. Results will be posted on this website as we go. Contestants can join at any time - there will be awards for long term successes at predictions, but there will also be plenty of interim recognition.The theme is movie success at the box office and in viewer ratings. Participants will be asked to predict how well a set of movies will do at the box office in terms of box office "take" (ticket sales) and how well they will do in the eyes of the viewers (the movies' viewer ratings) for their opening weekend in the U.S. A key feature of the challenge, though, is that contestants will use visual analytics to support their movie analysis and show us how it was used in their analytic processes. So, while the two numeric predictions would be possible to provide by plugging lots of data into a model, we will ask some additional questions to go along with the predictions that will require a human-in-the-loop and hopefully some outstanding visualizations.Read More http://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/VASTchallenge2013/MC1/BoxOfficeVAST-ChallengeDescription.pdf","http://hcil2.cs.umd.edu/newvarepository/VAST%20Challenge%202013/challenges/MC1%20-%20Box%20Office%20VAST%20-%20Predictive%20Visual%20Analytics/","http://hcil2.cs.umd.edu/newvarepository/VAST%20Challenge%202013/challenges/MC1%20-%20Box%20Office%20VAST%20-%20Predictive%20Visual%20Analytics/","Arizona State University","http://hcil2.cs.umd.edu/newvarepository/VAST%20Challenge%202013/challenges/MC1%20-%20Box%20Office%20VAST%20-%20Predictive%20Visual%20Analytics/entries/Arizona%20State%20University","Excellent Visual Analysis of Structured and Unstructured Data"

Contestants can join at any time - there will be awards for long term successes at predictions, but there will also be plenty of interim recognition.The theme is movie success at the box office and in viewer ratings. Participants will be asked to predict how well a set of movies will do at the box office in terms of box office "take" (ticket sales) and how well they will do in the eyes of the viewers (the movies' viewer ratings) for their opening weekend in the U.S. A key feature of the challenge, though, is that contestants will use visual analytics to support their movie analysis and show us how it was used in their analytic processes. So, while the two numeric predictions would be possible to provide by plugging lots of data into a model, we will ask some additional questions to go along with the predictions that will require a human-in-the-loop and hopefully some outstanding visualizations.Read More http://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/VASTchallenge2013/MC1/BoxOfficeVAST-ChallengeDescription.pdf","http://hcil2.cs.umd.edu/newvarepository/VAST%20Challenge%202013/challenges/MC1%20-%20Box%20Office%20VAST%20-%20Predictive%20Visual%20Analytics/","http://hcil2.cs.umd.edu/newvarepository/VAST%20Challenge%202013/challenges/MC1%20-%20Box%20Office%20VAST%20-%20Predictive%20Visual%20Analytics/","University of the Andes","http://hcil2.cs.umd.edu/newvarepository/VAST%20Challenge%202013/challenges/MC1%20-%20Box%20Office%20VAST%20-%20Predictive%20Visual%20Analytics/entries/University%20of%20the%20Andes",""
